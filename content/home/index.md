# Welcome to Legal Cultures and New Regional Policies towards Forced Migrants Project

This [WUN project](https://wun.ac.uk/wun/research/view/legal-cultures-and-new-regional-policies-towards-forced-migrants) connect experts in all major regions of the world to formulate and compare culturally-grounded legal policy approaches to improve the alarming conditions of refugees and other forced migrants, a crisis that displacements from climate change will likely make much worse.

The project is using a global hub-and-spoke network to advance and compare regionally-based ideas that can buttress the failing capacity of international refugee law. Three pilot projects are developed to address expectations that forced migrant flows will grow, exacerbated by the pressures of climate change. They will focus on Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia as sites for helping the status and rights of forced migrants in those regions and highlight European criminal law, Arab legal values and potential for regional cooperation, and South Asian legal institutions and practices The project will also develop additional pilot projects in other key global regions.
